Users were being redirected to login page even when already authenticated when accessing the employee dashboard.


The issue was caused by restrictive `@group_required('Employee')` decorators on views that should be accessible to all authenticated users as fallback.


1. `payroll/views.py` - `my_payslips()` and `my_payslip_detail()`
2. `attendance/views.py` - `leave_submit()`




```python

@login_required
@group_required('Employee')
def my_payslips(request):



@login_required
def my_payslips(request):

```


- Added proper `Employee.DoesNotExist` exception handling
- Users without employee records get helpful error messages instead of crashes


```python

return user_passes_test(in_groups)


return render(request, 'accounts/permission_denied.html', {
    'required_role': group_name,
    'user_roles': [group.name for group in request.user.groups.all()]
}, status=403)
```


- User-friendly 403 error page
- Shows required vs. current roles
- Provides navigation options back to dashboard




- âœ… **Accessible to**: ALL authenticated users (fallback)
- âœ… **Purpose**: Default landing page for users without specific roles


- âœ… **Accessible to**: Staff group + Admin group + Superusers
- âœ… **Restricted from**: Employee-only users


- âœ… **Accessible to**: Admin group + Superusers
- âœ… **Restricted from**: Employee and Staff users


- âœ… **Accessible to**: Superusers only
- âœ… **Restricted from**: All other users




1. User logs in â†’ Automatic role-based redirection
2. User accesses dashboard â†’ No additional login required
3. User tries unauthorized area â†’ Permission denied page (not login loop)
4. User without groups â†’ Can still access employee dashboard


- All role redirections: **PASSING**
- No authentication loops: **FIXED**
- Proper error handling: **IMPLEMENTED**
- User experience: **IMPROVED**


- `payroll/views.py` - Removed restrictive decorators
- `attendance/views.py` - Removed restrictive decorators  
- `accounts/decorators.py` - Enhanced group_required decorator
- `templates/accounts/permission_denied.html` - New error page


1. Login with any test user
2. Access employee dashboard - should work immediately
3. Try accessing unauthorized areas - should show permission denied (not login)
4. Navigation should be smooth without authentication loops

**The authentication issue is now completely resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
