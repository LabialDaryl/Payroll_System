The Payroll Management System now includes a comprehensive role-based access control system that automatically redirects users to their appropriate dashboards based on their assigned roles.



1. **Superuser** → `/django-admin/` (Django Admin Interface)
2. **Admin Group** → `/admin/` (Admin Dashboard)
3. **Staff Group** → `/staff/` (Staff Dashboard)
4. **Employee Group** → `/employee/` (Employee Dashboard)
5. **Default (No Group)** → `/employee/` (Employee Dashboard - fallback)




- Users are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard after login
- Superusers go directly to Django admin interface
- Group members go to their designated dashboards


- Prevents unauthorized access to role-specific areas
- Automatically redirects users trying to access unauthorized sections
- Maintains security while providing seamless user experience


- `get_role_based_redirect_url(user)` - Get appropriate URL for user
- `redirect_user_by_role(user)` - Get redirect response for user
- `user_has_role(user, role_name)` - Check if user has specific role


- Role information available in all templates:
  - `user_is_admin`
  - `user_is_staff`
  - `user_is_employee`
  - `user_is_superuser`




```bash
python manage.py setup_roles
```


1. Go to Django Admin (`/django-admin/`)
2. Navigate to **Users**
3. Edit a user
4. In the **Groups** section, assign appropriate groups:
   - **Employee**: Basic access to employee dashboard
   - **Staff**: Access to staff and employee dashboards
   - **Admin**: Access to admin, staff, and employee dashboards


```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```




```bash
python manage.py test_roles --create-test-users
```


```bash
python manage.py test_roles
```


1. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/`
3. Test with different user accounts:
   - `employee_user` / `testpass123` → Should redirect to `/employee/`
   - `staff_user` / `testpass123` → Should redirect to `/staff/`
   - `admin_user` / `testpass123` → Should redirect to `/admin/`
   - `superuser` / `superpass123` → Should redirect to `/django-admin/`



- `/` - Home (redirects based on role)
- `/accounts/login/` - Login page
- `/accounts/logout/` - Logout
- `/employee/` - Employee dashboard
- `/staff/` - Staff dashboard
- `/admin/` - Admin dashboard
- `/django-admin/` - Django admin interface



- **Middleware Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access attempts
- **Role Validation**: Checks user permissions before allowing access
- **Automatic Redirection**: Seamlessly guides users to appropriate areas
- **Superuser Override**: Superusers can access all areas




- `accounts/views.py` - Custom login view with role-based redirection
- `accounts/utils.py` - Role utility functions
- `accounts/middleware.py` - Access control middleware
- `accounts/context_processors.py` - Template context for roles
- `accounts/management/commands/` - Management commands for setup and testing
- `pms/settings.py` - Updated middleware and context processors
- `pms/urls.py` - Updated home URL to use role-aware view


1. **RoleBasedLoginView** - Handles login and redirection
2. **RoleBasedAccessMiddleware** - Enforces access control
3. **Management Commands** - Setup and testing utilities
4. **Utility Functions** - Reusable role checking logic




1. Check if user is assigned to correct group in Django admin
2. Verify groups exist: `Employee`, `Staff`, `Admin`
3. Check if middleware is properly configured in settings


1. Ensure user has appropriate group membership
2. Check middleware configuration
3. Verify URL patterns match role requirements


1. Ensure user has `is_superuser=True`
2. Check if Django admin URLs are accessible
3. Verify superuser credentials



- Permission-based access control (beyond groups)
- Dynamic role assignment
- Role-based menu systems
- Audit logging for role changes
- API endpoint protection
